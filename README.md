### 512 bytes Linux procedural graphics for In√©rcia Demoparty 2020

this doesn't use any libraries (not even the standard C library) and use two syscalls (open / mmap) to output to the Linux framebuffer device (fbdev), the magic happen in the code organization, symmetry, algorithms used (IFS Fractal / chaos game), GCC optimization flags and the compression stub / self executing shell script (without: 712 bytes)

goal was to port one of my IFS procedural gfx sketched in Processing as a C only 512 bytes linux intro

side goal was to serve as a proof of concept that many of my [2D IFS sketches](https://github.com/grz0zrg/Computer-Graphics) can be reduced to a <= 512 bytes program. I believe it can be done in less than 256 bytes also with agressive optimizations like ELF headers reduction or on different platform which doesn't have OS clutters like DOS with [Mode 13h](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_13h)

prototyped first with my [software graphics library](https://github.com/grz0zrg/fbg)

some tests were made with fixed point arithmetic instead of float but the binary size was nearly the same (~504 bytes), it was a quick & direct conversion with [fixedptc](https://sourceforge.net/projects/fixedptc/) so maybe there is still some bytes to gain with more fixed point optimizations / different fixed point representation.

Note : 32 bits binary (-m32) is slightly bigger than the 64 bits binary which is 504 bytes (1920x1080x32)

requirements:
* 32 bits /dev/fb0 (framebuffer) with supported resolution
* high quality: the framebuffer should be set to display resolution

how to run:
* switch to console with Ctrl+Alt+F2 (Ctrl+Alt+F1 to switch back to X)
* check /dev/fb0 is writable to you (or launch with sudo to bypass this step)
* check /dev/fb0 current resolution with fbset tool
* run the appropriate binary

permission issue: add current user to either 'tty' or 'video' group or use 'sudo'

change graphical terminal resolution:
* check supported resolution with "vbeinfo" in GRUB command prompt
* "GRUB_GFXMODE=WxH" in /etc/default/grub (where W/H is a value)
* sudo update-grub

the single line RNG come from [here](https://blog.demofox.org/2013/07/07/a-super-tiny-random-number-generator/)

code by grz and built with GCC 7.5.0
